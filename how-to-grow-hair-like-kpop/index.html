<p>Dont sleep with wet hair. They do perming use a lot of hair spray pin their hair at the roots so it does that flippy arching at the top to get that anime hair effect and get it thinnedlayered 21 level 2 nakeforgotname 2y. Or is it just a result of regular hair care. Hair oils and leave-in conditioners are also great for dry hair and should be used after you wash and condition your hair. Pin On Ateez.</p>

<p>Another handy Korean trick is to use an apple cider vinegar rinse weekly. If you want to be like the fashion God G-Dragon then you have to dye your hair like him too. Commonly many Kpop idols dye their hair with bold and bright colors. There are quite a few tutorials in korean of guys and girls who have very kpop inspired hair on YouTube - try looking for male GRWM type videos and youll see how they do their hair.
