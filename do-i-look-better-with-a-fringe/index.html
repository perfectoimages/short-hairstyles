<p>From a subtle side-sweeping fringe or a light wispy fringe to choppy full bangs à la 60s Jane Birken - everyone can get become firmly acquainted with the very covetable hair trend that took off again n a big way last year thanks to Daisy Edgar-Jones. Well kick things off this week with the round face shape and then stay tuned for long square heart inverted triangle pear diamond and oval. A softer side-swept fringe or angled fringe are great if you arent quite ready to go for fuller bangs or blunt bangs because they are less of a commitment to styleand grow out. Note the slight choppiness on the ends which breaks them up a bit and adds softness. Pin On Hair Beauty.</p>
