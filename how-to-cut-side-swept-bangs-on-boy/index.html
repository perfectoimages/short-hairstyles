<p>Cut Them Dry While they cut your hair when its wet at the salon when youre cutting bangs yourself cut them dry. To style a straight or side-swept angular fringe youll need at least 2 to 4 inches of hair in the front and your stylist will need to cut your bangs at an angle for the latter. If you choose a short version of the haircut it will focus on the face. Wear your bangs on the short side and emphasize symmetry and angular cuts.
